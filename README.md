# SQL-Injection
This project demonstrates SQL injection vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies. It provides a hands-on example of how SQL injection attacks can be executed and how to defend against them. Key features include:

    Vulnerability Demonstration: Illustrates common SQL injection techniques, including basic and advanced attacks.
    Mitigation Strategies: Showcases methods for preventing SQL injection, such as parameterized queries, prepared statements, and input validation.
    Interactive Examples: Includes a sample web application with intentional vulnerabilities for educational purposes.

The repository contains code examples, a vulnerable web application, and detailed instructions for running and testing the project.
